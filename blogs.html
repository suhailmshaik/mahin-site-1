      <h2>Blog on organic farming</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s talk about organic farming. This is an agricultural system that
        utilizes green manure, compost, biological pest control and crop
        rotation to produce crops, livestock and poultry. It’s a system that
        cultivates resources to conserve biodiversity and support ecological
        balance. Some of the primary aspects of organic farming are to augment
        the soil’s biological activity, enhance the fertility of the soil, and
        use green manure, cover crops, animal manure, and soil rotation to
        disturb the habitation of pests and diseases. Synthetic chemical
        fertilizers, antibiotics, herbicides or pesticides aren’t used in
        organic farming. The goal within organic farming is to manage
        agricultural production in the best natural way. Organic farming
        contributes added protection to the soil which in turn is crucial for
        exceptional productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organic farming isn’t about increasing or maximizing a greater yield of
        productivity, but rather ensuring the sustainable production of high
        quality healthy food while maintaining crop and livestock diversity and
        respecting the environment. Organic farming contributes to energy
        conservation through making extensive use of direct solar energy and
        saving other energy sources taken directly from the earth’s resources.
        It also contributes to the reduction of water and air pollution in that
        pesticides, herbicides, synthetic chemical fertilizer residues do not
        enter the air or water which reduces the costs for the state to pay for
        water treatment. Organic farming contributes to the overall health of
        the population since organic produced food improves the health of those
        who consume it which positively impacts the states’s expenses and costs
        of healthcare. Sustainable farming creates an environment that attracts
        tourists which can improve the state economy. Small farms become more
        integrated into the system since they are involved in production and the
        education system which encourages a reduction of unemployment and
        decreases social exclusion of the rural population. The initial costs of
        organic farming may be higher, but its impact are cheaper and more
        efficient in the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        Farmers in organic farming need new sustainable mechanization to help
        ease and reduce hard labour, relieve labour shortages, improve
        agricultural productivity and timeliness of operations, advance the
        efficient use of resources, boost market access, and assists in
        alleviating climate related hazards. According to a report from the
        World Bank, demand for food will increase by 70% by 2050; at least $80
        billion annual investments will be needed to meet this demand. They say
        that agriculture finance empowers poor farmers to increase their wealth
        and food production to be able to feed 9 billion people by 2050. In
        order for farmers to be able to do this, farmers need to have access to
        improved agricultural tools and sustainable mechanization. A UN report
        states, “Sustainable mechanization supports the development of food
        supply chains through improved agricultural practices for increased
        production and enhanced food security.” Sustainable mechanization
        applies to simple basic hand tools to more advanced and motorized
        equipment. It involves agricultural land preparation, reinforces timely
        seeding and planting, weed control, consolidates pest management,
        provides for precise fertilizer application and much much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sustainable mechanization can increase the power supply to organic
        farming and that means more tasks can be completed at the right time and
        greater areas can be farmed to produce greater quantities of crops while
        conserving natural resources. Using sustainable mechanization can enable
        farmers to produce crops more efficiently by using less power.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to provide for this need is to match organic farmers with the
        right retail investors. Retailers have longstanding relationships with
        their customers which means they want to invest in farmers who can meet
        the supply and demand of their customers. Agriculture finance and
        sustainable investments in agricultural projects can ensure that the
        right retail investors are building worthwhile relationships with
        organic farmers who have access to sustainable mechanization. This will
        help to provide market-based safety nets, and fund long-term investment
        to support sustainable economic growth.
